# Task 1 â€” Student Score Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Description
The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts students' exam scores based on:
- Hours Studied
- Attendance
- Derived feature: Hours_Attendance (Hours_Studied Ã— Attendance)

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
**Source:** [Student Performance Factors â€” Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)  
Each record contains study-related and lifestyle factors affecting student performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Checked data types and missing values.
   - Created a new feature: `Hours_Attendance`.
   
2. **Visualization**
   - Distribution plot of Exam Scores.
   - Scatter plots for relationships between variables.
   - Correlation heatmap.

3. **Modeling**
   - Linear Regression model to predict `Exam_Score`.
   - Train-test split with 80/20 ratio.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics:
     - **MAE:** 1.47
     - **MSE:** 5.80
   - Plotted Actual vs Predicted scores.

5. **Bonus**
   - Implemented Polynomial Regression (degree=2).
   - Tried alternative feature combinations.
