## ðŸš€ Tasks Overview

### **Task 1 â€” Student Score Prediction**
- Predict exam scores based on study hours, attendance, and derived features.
- Includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression modeling.
- Bonus: Polynomial Regression and feature combination experiments.

---

### **Task 2 â€” Customer Segmentation**
- Segment customers based on annual income and spending score using clustering techniques.  
- Perform EDA with feature distributions and scatter plots to understand patterns.  
- Determine optimal clusters using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.  
- Apply **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** to identify customer groups.  
- Analyze cluster characteristics, including average income, spending score, and customer count.

### **Task 3 â€” Forest Cover Type Classification**
- Predict forest cover types (7 classes) using cartographic and terrain features.  
- Includes exploratory data analysis: target distribution, elevation patterns, soil type frequencies, and correlation heatmaps.  
- Preprocessing: label encoding of the target and train-test split with stratification.  
- Models trained: Decision Tree, XGBoost, Random Forest.  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.  
- Feature importance analysis highlights the most influential features for classification.

### **Task 4 â€” Loan Approval Prediction**
- Predict loan approval (Approved / Not Approved) based on applicant features.  
- Preprocessing includes handling missing values, label encoding, feature scaling, and balancing imbalanced data with SMOTE.  
- Models trained: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier.  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix visualization.
